* enemies don't become invisible when screen scrolling.

* can't shoot frost barrier to the right when on a ladder.

* when death in water, goes back to non water physics.

* boss gets stuck in wall sometimes

* going into boss room with half charge makes the color stay as half scharged if continuing to hold charge
